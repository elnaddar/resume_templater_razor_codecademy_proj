Build Web Apps with ASP.NET

# Resume Templater

You’re currently in the early stages of building an application to
showcase your resume online and certain pages need to be filled out;
both view pages and page models. Using your knowledge of Razor Syntax
you’ll be able to populate certain pages with your personal information.

- The **Index** page will contain data regarding your experience, and
  technical skills about what programming languages you know.
- The **Projects** page will contain information about the projects you
  have built!

Both of these view pages will have their own respective page models that
you’ll fill out and by the end of this project, you should have a good
resume template that you can use dynamically!
